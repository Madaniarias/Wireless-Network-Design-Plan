-This map shows the percentage of consumers around the world who have mobile internet access
-people usually got fixed internet access first and obtained mobile internet devices later. But some developing countries are skipping the construction of fixed broadband networks altogether.
-One cellphone tower, hundreds of costumers
-Mobile internet access can have profound implications for people in isolated areas.
-A few wealthy countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Sweden, that have more mobile internet subscriptions than people. 
-Some have more than 1 device

-the fastest internet in the world is in Hong Kong, with an average of almost 80 million bits per second (Mbps).
-Other high-speed countries include Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Romania, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

-For the internet to work, everyone needs a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address.
- Internet broken into 5 zones, assigned hundreds of millions of IP addresses.
- Original architecture, called IPv4, only allows for about 4 billion addresses, and the network has nearly exhausted the supply.
- Engineers have developed a long-run solution to this problem: switching to a new internet standard called IPv6. IPv6 offers such a large number of potential addresses that the world will never run out. But adoption of IPv6 has been slow.

- For users not to remember number IP addresses but it is easier to remember domain names. DNS (Domain Name System) telling computers what ip adress to access.
- Ex. The system is hierarchical: the .com domain is managed by a company caled Verisign, which has delegated to Vox the management of the vox.com domain
- Generic top-level domains: .com, .org, and .edu (US)
- Other countries use country-code top level domains (ccTLD)

# 15: Some small island nations lend their domains to internet startups

- Even very small countries get ccTLDs.
- Money opening domains to foreigners
- Popular domains like twitch.tv (.tv is the domain for the island nation of Tuvalu)
- The .io domain, assigned to the British Indian Ocean Territory, has become popular among programmers.
